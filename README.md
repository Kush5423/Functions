A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.
In simple terms, a function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.
